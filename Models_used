The models used for the AI-Based Cyber Security Threats Prediction project are:

  Random Forest: Supervised classification model for identifying attack types.
  XGBoost: Supervised classification model optimized for speed and accuracy in threat detection.
  Isolation Forest: Unsupervised model for anomaly and threat detection in network traffic.
  Autoencoder: Neural network model for unsupervised anomaly detection.
  LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): Recurrent neural network, useful for sequential data and time-series-based threat detection.
  LLM-based Chatbot (LangChain+LlamaIndex with OpenAI API or Ollama Llama 2): For natural language query handling, explanations, and admin commands in the chatbot interface (fine-tuned on cybersecurity knowledge).
